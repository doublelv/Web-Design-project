                                        <p>You can't transmit your car's power and handling
                                                potential to the road without the right tire
                                                setup because tyre pressure affects a tire's
                                                peak grip, responsiveness, and wear.
                                                Adjust tire pressure when the tires 
                                                are cold so they reach peak grip once they 
                                                have heated up to race temperatures.</p>

                                        <p>Setting tire pressure lower causes the tires to
                                                heat up faster, but it can reduce overall responsiveness.
                                                Setting tire pressure higher can increase speed 
                                                and responsiveness, but it makes the tires more 
                                                prone to sudden loss of grip. Having the front 
                                                tires closer to peak grip than the rear tires 
                                                increases the car's ability to turn in, but it 
                                                can cause excessive oversteer if the diff. is too great.</p>

                                        <p>Adjusting the final drive ration(the ratio of the 
                                                ring and pinion gears in the differential) 
                                                affects acceleration and stop speed by scaling 
                                                the ratios of all the gears in the gearbox. 
                                                Choosing the right ratio matches your engine's
                                                power and torque to the circuiton witch you are racing.

                                                <p>To determine the final drive ratio, device all the number 
                                                of teeth on the fing gear by the number of teeth on the pinion gear.
                                                 A ring with 41 teeth and a pinion gear with 10 teeth yields a 
                                                ratio 4.10:1, so the driveshaft rotates 3.1 times for each turn of the wheels.
                                                A higher final drive ratio provides better acceleration. A lower ratio gives 
                                                better top speed and fuel economy.</p>

                                        <p>Antiroll bars (also called antisway bars) provide extra stability
                                                when cornering. They control unwanted body movement and 
                                                balance understeer versus oversteer in steady-state cornering
                                                (for example, in the middle of a sweeping turn). When you
                                                turn left or right, the car body tends to roll in the opposite direction.
                                                By tying the left and right sides of the suspension together, antisway 
                                                bars make the car ride more level and keep one side from rolling or 
                                                swaying more than the other.</p>
        
                                        <p>Decreasing rear antiroll stiffness reduces 
                                                oversteer. Increasing rear antiroll stiffness increases oversteer, 
                                                but excessive antiroll stiffness can cause the inside tires to lift off 
                                                the ground during hard cornering. The balance of front and rear antiroll 
                                                stiffness affects the balance between understeer and oversteer.</p>
